JETPACK JOYRIDE

To play, build, and run the graphics_asgn1 executable in the build folder.

Gameplay:
- Left and right arrow keys to move back and forward respectively
- Space to move up using the jetpack
- Down to drop water balloon
- 3 lives

Win points by collecting coins or fuel cans. Avoid the fire beams (they move!) and
boomerangs. Fire beams take a life, and boomerangs cause you to lose points.
In the green semicircular tunnel, you are protected from the boomerangs and
beams.

Have fun!
